                  <span>A Smart Choice?</span></h2>
                  <h4>Traditionally investing in "defensive" stocks was used by many traders as a risk management technique in order to
                  safeguard their portfolios during potential economic downturns, albeit often at the cost of
                  more modest returns. However, high-tech stocks, particularly Apple shares, are catching attention
                  in this context. Many analysts, echoing sentiments similar to those at Morgan Stanley, have highlighted Apple as stock
                  that offers resilience.</h4>

              <p>MCA INTELIFUNDS LTD, trading as “FXORO”, is a financial services company incorporated and
                registered under the laws of the Republic of Cyprus, licensed and regulated by the Cyprus
                Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) with license number 126/10.</p>

              <p>Risk disclaimer</p>
              <p>CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage.
                75.28% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider. You should
                consider whether you understand how CFDs work and whether you can afford to take the high risk
                of losing your money.</p>
              <p>The National Securities Market commission of Spain (the “CNMV”) has determined that, due to the
                complexity of CFDs and the risks involved, the purchase of such a product by Retail Clients is
                not appropriate/suitable. In this respect, pursuant to the relevant requirements introduced by
                CNMV, you are warned that you are about to purchase a product that is complex and difficult to
                understand: Contracts for Differences (CFDs). CNMV has determined that, due to its complexity
                and the risks involved, the purchase of this product by retail investors is not
                appropriate/suitable.</p>
              <p>Because of such, CFDs may not be the ideal investment for everyone. The high rate of leverage
                that is available to CFD traders can work for or against you. You should only invest money that
                you can afford to lose. CFDs are intricate leveraged financial assets. Trading Forex,
                Commodities, Indexes and Shares based CFDs, or any other underlaying instruments of the Company
                implies a high degree of risk and can lead to the loss of your investment. Before getting
                involved with trading, consider your financial goals, your skills and gage the possible risks
                associated with trading Company’s Products. Derivate assets like CFDs and likely instruments
                from other markets can present extreme volatility. CFDs may shift price rapidly and may depict
                change in market conditions that result from unforeseeable occurrences. None of these facts can
                be manipulated by either you or FXORO. It is best to consult with a licensed financial
                counselor. FXORO does not avail its customers with financial advice and the information provided
                herein is intended for marketing purposes only. Past performance is not an indicator for future

                trading Company’s Products.</p>
