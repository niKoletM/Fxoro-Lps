                    <ol type="a">
                      <li>This Notice is directed towards all prospective Clients, and should be read carefully by all interested
                        parties towards which it is directed. It should be noted that the Notice alone cannot and does not, contain nor
                        explain all of the risks and practices involved when a Client is dealing in Financial Instruments and/or
                        Contracts for Difference (“CFDs”). The purpose of this Notice is to explain, fairly, clearly and in general
                        terms, the nature of the risks involved when dealing in Financial Instruments.</li>
                      <li>The Client must only engage, directly or indirectly in investments in Financial Instruments when the Client
                        knows and understands the risks involved in each one of the Financial Instruments. <span
                          class="text-bold">FXORO</span> shall not, at any given time during investment or otherwise, be providing
                        the Client with any investment advice relating to investments or possible transactions in investments or in
                        Financial Instruments. Further, <span class="text-bold">FXORO</span> will not, at any given time during
                        investment or otherwise, be making investment recommendations of any kind to the Client.</li>
                      <li>It is the Client’s responsibility, taking into account his personal circumstances and financial resources, to
                        take particular care and make careful considerations independently, both prior to applying for a trading account
                        with <span class="text-bold">FXORO</span>, and prior to making any individual order. Where the Client does not
                        understand the risks involved in applying for a trading account with <span class="text-bold">FXORO</span> or in
                        making any individual order, the Client should seek advice and consultation from an independent Financial
                        Advisor. If the Client continues to not understand the risks involved in trading in any Financial Instruments,
                        the Client should not trade at all.</li>
                      <li>The Client must acknowledge that the purchase and/or sale of any Financial Instrument poses a great risk of
                        incurring losses and damages, and the Client must accept that he is willing to undertake this risk.</li>

                  <li><strong>GENERAL RISKS</strong><br>
                    <span class="text-bold">FXORO</span> makes known and warns the Client of the following, non-exhaustive list of
                    risks:<p></p>
                    <ol type="a">
                      <li>The Initial Capital of the Client’s portfolio and/or its value and or any money invested by the Client in any
                        Financial Instrument cannot be, and are not guaranteed by <span class="text-bold">FXORO</span>.</li>
                      <li>The Client accepts that, the value of any investment in Financial Instruments may fluctuate downwards or
                        upwards and also accepts the probability that any investment may, at any given time become of no value in spite
                        of any information (to the contrary or otherwise) which may be offered by <span class="text-bold">FXORO</span>
                        at any time.</li>
                      <li>The Client acknowledges that information known of a Financial Instrument’s previous performance does not in
                        any way guarantee its current and/or future performance. Using historical data does not amount to a binding or
                        safe forecast with regards to the current and/or future performance of the Financial Instruments to which the
                        said information refers.</li>
                      <li><span class="text-bold">FXORO</span> advises the Client that any transactions that may take place via  <span class="text-bold">FXORO</span>’s dealing services may be of a speculative nature. The Client is advised
                        that large losses may occur in a short period of time.</li>
                      <li>The Client acknowledges that there are cases whereby Financial Instruments may not become immediately liquid
                        (for example, as a result of reduced demand). The client further acknowledges that in these cases the Client may
                        not be in a position neither to sell the said Financial Instruments nor easily obtain information on their value
                        and/or the extent of their associated risks.</li>
                      <li>Where Financial Instruments are traded in a currency other than the currency of the Client’s country of
                        residence, any changes in the exchange rates may have a negative effect on the Financial Instruments’ value,
                        price and performance.</li>
                      <li><span class="text-bold">FXORO</span> hereby advises the Client that Financial Instruments traded on foreign
                        markets may entail risks that are different and/or greater than the usual risks of the Client’s country of
                        residence market.<br>
                        The prospect of profit or loss from transactions on foreign markets is also affected by exchange rate
                        fluctuations.</li>
                      <li>The Client acknowledges that Derivative Financial Instruments (such as options, futures, forwards, swaps,
                        CFDs, NDFs) may be non-delivery spot transactions which may give rise to an opportunity to make profit on
                        changes in currency rates, commodity, stock market indices or share prices called by their respective underlying
                        instruments. <span class="text-bold">FXORO</span> advises the Client that the value of the Derivative Financial
                        Instrument may be directly affected by the price of the relevant underlying instrument.</li>
                      <li>The Client is hereby advised not to purchase a Derivative Financial Instrument unless the Client is willing to
                        undertake the risk of losing the investment he has made entirely, as well as any additional commissions and
                        other expenses incurred.</li>
                      <li>The Client acknowledges that a prospective insolvency of <span class="text-bold">FXORO</span> and/ or of a
                        Bank and/ or of a Broker used by <span class="text-bold">FXORO</span> may result in the Client’s positions being
                        closed out against his wishes.</li>
                      <li>The Client is advised that the execution of an order may be difficult or impossible under certain market
                        conditions. Further, <span class="text-bold">FXORO</span> advises the Client that  <span class="text-bold">FXORO</span> could be dealing through Banks and Brokers that may have interests contrary
                        to the Client’s interests.</li>
                      <li>The Client acknowledges that, in the course of trading, there are currencies traded so irregularly or
                        infrequently that it cannot be certain that a price will be quoted at all times. The Client’s attention is
                        expressly drawn to these currencies and he is warned that it may be difficult to effect transactions at a price
                        which may be quoted, due to the absence of a counter party.</li>
                      <li>The Client is advised that the risks associated with currency trading are not eliminated by trading on – line,
                        regardless of the convenience or efficiency this mode of trading may provide.</li>
                      <li>The Client’s attention is expressly drawn to movements that occur after the release of significant
                        macroeconomic figures, economic or political news which may take place at weekend, at the beginning of a week,
                        during the course of a business day or at any other time, that may make currency markets to open at price levels
                        which are substantially different from prices previously quoted. The Client is advised that the abovementioned
                        movements poses significant risk that there may be orders issued to protect open positions and/or new positions
                        which may be executed at prices which significantly differ from those designated.</li>

                  <li><strong>THIRD PARTY RISKS</strong>
                    <ol type="a">
                      <li><span class="text-bold">FXORO</span> may pass money received from the Client to a third party (e.g. a bank) to
                        hold or control in order to effect a Transaction through or with that person or to satisfy the Client’s
                        obligation to provide collateral (e.g. initial margin requirement) in respect of a Transaction.  <span class="text-bold">FXORO</span> has no responsibility for any acts or omissions of any third party to whom
                        it will pass money received from the Client.</li>
                      <li>The third party to whom <span class="text-bold">FXORO</span> will pass money may hold it in an omnibus account
                        and it may not be possible to separate it from the Client’s money, or the third party’s money. In the event of
                        the insolvency or any other analogous proceedings in relation to that third party,  <span class="text-bold">FXORO</span> may only have an unsecured claim against the third party on behalf of the
                        Client, and the Client will be exposed to the risk that the money received by  <span class="text-bold">FXORO</span> from the third party is insufficient to satisfy the claims of the Client
                        with claims in respect of the relevant account. <span class="text-bold">FXORO</span> does not accept any
                        liability or responsibility for any resulting losses.</li>

                  <li><strong>RISKS PARTICULARLY ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSACTIONS IN CFDs</strong>
                    <p  >CFDs are derivative financial instruments, where their price is derived from the price of the
                      underlying instrument to which the CFDs refer. Derivative financial instruments and related markets can be highly
                      volatile.</p>
                    <p  >The prices of CFDs and the underlying instrument may fluctuate rapidly and over wide ranges and may
                      reflect unforeseeable events or changes in conditions, none of which can be controlled by the Client or <i
                        class="textLogo">FX<i>ORO</i></i>. Under certain market conditions it may be impossible for a Client’s order to
                      be executed at declared price leading to losses. The prices of CFDs will be influenced by, amongst other things,
                      changing supply and demand relationships, governmental, agricultural, commercial and trade programs and policies,
                      national and international political and economic events and the prevailing psychological characteristics of the
                      relevant market place.</p>
                    <p>Please be aware of all the risks associated with trading on such products, and seek advice and consultation from
                      an independent financial advisor, if needed. Before getting involved with trading, consider your financial goals,
                      your skills, knowledge and experience associated with trading Company’s Products.</p>

                    <p  >Where we treat you as a Professional Client, you will be entitled to fewer protections under the Law,
                      than you would be entitled to as a Retail client. In particular:</p>

                        in trading with leverage / margin;</li>
                      <li>When providing you with Best Execution we are not required to prioritize the overall costs of the transaction

                        charges that are not expressed in money terms (e.g. expressed as a dealing spread), the Client must ask for a

                        of any system failure may be that his order is either not executed according to his instructions or it is not

                      certain price, the market may have moved significantly and the order would be filled at the next best price or the
                      fair market value. Similarly, increased volume may also result in slippage if sufficient liquidity does not exist
                      to execute all trades at the requested rate.</p>
                    <p  >Once a stop is triggered, it becomes an At Best market order, and there is no guarantee it will be

                <p>MCA INTELIFUNDS LTD, trading as “<span class="bold">FXORO</span>”, is a financial
                  services company incorporated and registered under the laws of
                  the Republic of Cyprus, licensed and regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission
                  (CySEC) with license
                  number 126/10.</p>
                <p>Address: Petrou Tsirou 82, Mesa Geitonia, 3076, Limassol, Cyprus.</p>
                <p>Clients funds are held in segregated accounts and insured by the client compensation funds subject to
                  eligibility.</p>
                <p>Risk disclaimer.</p>
                <p>CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage.
                  75.28% of retail
                  investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider. You should consider whether you
                  understand how CFDs
                  work and whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money.</p>
                <p>The National Securities Market commission of Spain (the “CNMV”) has determined that, due to the
                  complexity of CFDs and
                  the risks involved, the purchase of such a product by Retail Clients is not appropriate/suitable. In
                  this respect,
                  pursuant to the relevant requirements introduced by CNMV, you are warned that you are about to
                  purchase a product that
                  is complex and difficult to understand: Contracts for Differences (CFDs). CNMV has determined that,
                  due to its
                  complexity and the risks involved, the purchase of this product by retail investors is not
                  appropriate/suitable.</p>
                <p>Because of such, CFDs may not be the ideal investment for everyone. The high rate of leverage that is
                  available to CFD
                  traders can work for or against you. You should only invest money that you can afford to lose. CFDs
                  are intricate
                  leveraged financial assets. Trading Forex, Commodities, Indexes and Shares based CFDs, or any other
                  underlaying
                  instruments of the Company implies a high degree of risk and can lead to the loss of your investment.
                  Before getting
                  involved with trading, consider your financial goals, your skills and gage the possible risks
                  associated with trading
                  Company’s Products. Derivate assets like CFDs and likely instruments from other markets can present
                  extreme volatility.
                  CFDs may shift price rapidly and may depict change in market conditions that result from unforeseeable
                  occurrences. None
                  of these facts can be manipulated by either you or <span class="bold">FXORO</span>.
                  It is best to consult with a licensed financial counselor.
